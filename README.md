# Video Tracking with OpenCV

This project implements a video tracking application using OpenCV's CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking) tracker. It allows users to select a region of interest (ROI) in a video via mouse interaction, track the selected object across frames, and display a resized preview of the tracked region overlaid on the video output. The processed video is saved to a file.

## Features
- **Interactive ROI Selection**: Click and drag with the left mouse button to define the tracking region.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Utilizes OpenCV's CSRT tracker for robust object tracking.
- **Preview Overlay**: Displays a resized view of the tracked region in the top-left corner of the video.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Supports configurable input/output paths, video size, and codec.
- **Error Handling**: Includes exception handling for robust operation.

## Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) supporting C++17 or later.
- **OpenCV**: Version 4.x (tested with 4.11.0).
- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher for building the project.
- **Operating System**: Tested on macOS; should work on Linux/Windows with minor adjustments.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-tracking.git
cd video-tracking
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
#### On macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install opencv
```

#### On Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

#### On Windows
- Download OpenCV from [opencv.org](https://opencv.org/releases/).
- Extract and set up environment variables (e.g., add `opencv/build/x64/vc15/bin` to PATH).

### 3. Build the Project
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This generates an executable named `tracking` (or similar, depending on your `CMakeLists.txt`).

## Usage

### Running the Program
1. Place a video file (e.g., `track.mp4`) in the specified directory or update `DEFAULT_VIDEO_PATH` in `main.cpp`.
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./tracking
   ```
3. In the video window:
   - **Left-click and drag** to select the ROI.
   - **Release** to start tracking.
   - Press any key to exit.

### Output
- The processed video is saved as `tracked_output.mp4` in the working directory.
- The tracked ROI is outlined in red, with a preview shown in the top-left corner.

### Customization
Edit the `Config` struct in `main.cpp` to change:
- `input_path`: Path to the input video.
- `output_path`: Path for the output video.
- `output_size`: Resolution of the output video (default: 1024x800).
- `codec`: Video codec (default: X264).

Example:
```cpp
VideoProcessing::Config custom_config{
    .input_path = "/path/to/your/video.mp4",
    .output_path = "custom_output.mp4",
    .output_size = cv::Size(1280, 720),
    .codec = cv::VideoWriter::fourcc('M', 'J', 'P', 'G')
};
VideoProcessing::VideoProcessor processor(custom_config);
processor.process();
```

## Code Structure
- **Namespace**: `VideoProcessing`
- **Key Classes**:
  - `TrackerManager`: Manages the OpenCV CSRT tracker.
  - `VideoProcessor`: Handles video processing, ROI selection, and tracking.
  - `Config`: Configuration struct for video parameters.
  - `RegionOfInterest`: Struct for ROI state management.
- **Main Functions**:
  - `process()`: Main processing loop.
  - `handleMouseInteraction()`: Handles ROI selection via mouse events.
  - `processTrackedRegion()`: Processes and overlays the tracked region.

## Example `CMakeLists.txt`
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(VideoTracking)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(tracking main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tracking ${OpenCV_LIBS})
```

### Notes
- Replace `yourusername` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username.
- If you have a specific `CMakeLists.txt` or additional files (e.g., `LICENSE`), mention them in the README or adjust the build instructions accordingly.
- You might want to add a sample video or screenshot to the repo and link it in the README (e.g., under a "Screenshots" section).
